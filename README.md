Welcome to Project "Perkele"!  In this README-file, we will shortly describe the project, what it is based on, and how it has been compiled. You can read a more detailed description of the project in the wiki.

Perkele is a group project in the Object Oriented Software Engineering course on the 4th semester of Medialogy on AAU CPH, Denmark. The project is created by Emil Holmen, Andreas Ryge og Rasmus Bons, and is based on the concept of Blizzards game Diablo 2.
In Perkele you play as an unfornunate hero who had a run-in with the Finnish Devil, who took all your loot and left you (almost) naked with only a smelly stick to defend yourself. Now it is up to you to battle through the horde of dwarfs and elves(Perkele's allied), take their loot and take the fight to Perkele himself, to extract revenge for your missing loot.
